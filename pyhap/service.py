    A Service contains multiple characteristics. For example, a TemperatureSensor service
    has the characteristic CurrentTemperature.

    For the services that iOS natively supports, we distinguish two types of
    characteristics - (1) "mandatory", which must be present when communciating with an
    iOS client, and (2) optional, which may or may not be present. All mandatory and
    optional characteristics for iOS-supported services are defined in the
    resources/services.json file. When you load a service using the loader module, only
    the mandatory characteristics are aded - you need to add any optional characteristics
    yourself. This is because once a charateristic is present, iOS will want values for
    it and we need to know how to set these.
