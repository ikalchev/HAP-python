"""AccessoryDriver - glues together the HAP Server, accessories and mDNS advertising.

Sending updates to clients

The process of sending value changes to clients happens in two parts - on one hand, the
value change is indicated by a Characteristic and, on the other, that change is sent to a
client. To begin, typically, something in the Accessory's run method will do
set_value(foo, notify=True) on one of its contained Characteristic. This in turn will
create a HAP representation of the change and publish it to the Accessory. This will
then add some more information and eventually the value change will reach the
AccessoryDriver (all this happens through the publish() interface). The AccessoryDriver
will then check if there is a client that subscribed for events from this exact
Characteristic from this exact Accessory (remember, it could be a Bridge with more than
one Accessory in it). If so, the event is put in a FIFO queue - the event queue. This
terminates the call chain and concludes the publishing process from the Characteristic,
the Characteristic does not block waiting for the actual send to happen.

When the AccessoryDriver is started, it spawns an event dispatch thread. The purpose of
this thread is to get events from the event queue and send them to subscribed clients.
Whenever a send fails, the client is unsubscribed, as it is assumed that the client left
or went to sleep before telling us. This concludes the publishing process from the
AccessoryDriver.
